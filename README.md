### What is Jangle?
Jangle is a content management system built on __NodeJS__, __MongoDB__, and __Elm__.

It's goal is to make maintaining large amounts of content simpler by automatically generating an API for all of your data. On top of that, Jangle provides a simple UI to help interact with this API, and easily track versions of your stuff, as well as decide what should be publicly available.

Jangle is currently a work in progress.
